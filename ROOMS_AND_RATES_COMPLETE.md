## 🔧 Technical Details

### Type Safety
All components are fully typed with TypeScript:
- `RatePlan` interface in `lib/types.ts`
- `RoomType` interface updated with all fields
- `CreateRatePlanRequest` and `UpdateRatePlanRequest`
- Type-safe API calls

### State Management
- React `useState` for component state
- `useEffect` for data fetching on mount
- No global state (follows existing pattern)

### API Integration
- Clean separation in `lib/api.ts`
- Error handling with try-catch
- Loading states during API calls
- User feedback with alerts (basic, can be enhanced)

### Code Organization
```
frontend/
├── app/
│   └── rooms-and-rates/
│       └── page.tsx                    (Main page)
├── components/

## 📝 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **No editing:** Can only create and delete, not edit (can add edit functionality)
2. **Basic error messages:** Using browser alerts (should use toast notifications)
3. **No pagination:** All items loaded at once (fine for small datasets)
4. **No image upload:** Media step is placeholder
5. **No individual rooms:** Only room types, not specific room instances
6. **Page reload after create:** Could be improved with state updates

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Edit Modals:** Add edit functionality for rate plans and room types
2. **Toast Notifications:** Replace alerts with elegant toast messages
3. **Image Upload:** Implement media library integration
4. **Individual Rooms:** Add UI for managing specific room instances
5. **Rate Calendar:** Visual calendar for setting daily rates
6. **Bulk Actions:** Select and delete multiple items
7. **Advanced Filters:** More filter options (date ranges, status, etc.)
8. **Search:** Search bar for finding specific rate plans/room types
9. **Sorting:** Sort by different fields (name, date, etc.)
10. **Export:** Export rate plans and room types to Excel/PDF
